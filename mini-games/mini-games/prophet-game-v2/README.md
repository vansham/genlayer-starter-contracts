# GenLayer Prophet v2

Multiplayer Optimistic Consensus Game for GenLayer Community.

GenLayer Prophet v2 is a fun educational mini-game where players act as validators in a consensus system.  
Players submit predictions, majority vote becomes the truth, and XP is distributed based on accuracy and speed.

This game demonstrates:
- GenLayer’s Optimistic Democracy
- Intelligent Contracts logic
- Validator incentives
- Consensus through majority voting

## How to Run

1. Download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any browser
3. Create a room and invite friends using the room code
4. Play and experience consensus in action

## Features

- Multiplayer rooms
- 6 rounds per game
- Speed-based XP rewards
- Final leaderboard
- Weekly question sets
- Fully client-side, no backend required

Built for GenLayer Community Mini-Game Mission.


## Why This Game Matters

This game is designed to make GenLayer concepts easy to understand through practice.
Instead of reading theory, players experience:
- How consensus is formed
- How validators are rewarded
- How optimistic assumptions work in real time

It turns GenLayer’s ideas into something you can feel, play, and understand.

Built for the GenLayer Community Mini-Game Mission to showcase Optimistic Democracy
and Intelligent Contracts in an interactive and educational way.

## Intelligent Contract Simulation

This game uses a simulated GenLayer-style Intelligent Contract inside the frontend.

The contract handles:
- Prediction submission
- Majority consensus resolution
- Speed-based XP rewards
- Validator reputation via globalScores

This mirrors how GenLayer validators reach agreement on non-deterministic execution.

This project includes a Python-based GenLayer-style Intelligent Contract
located at contracts/prophet_contract_v2.py which demonstrates:
- Optimistic Democracy
- Validator rewards
- Majority consensus
- Speed-based incentives
